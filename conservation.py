# script to check and plot (as a heatmap) the conservation between the sequences 
# potentially multiple sequences for each species? so could plot both conservation within and between species.

# check: does input files exist
# check: does it have more than one sequence
# check: does it have fewer than 1000 sequences? if so, give user the choice to either use first N sequences or exit (check they give an int less than 1001 or the string "exit"

# take input fasta file, and split into a list; one item for each sequence. (could potentiall make list of lists?)
