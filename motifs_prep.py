# script to prep for using PROSITE database to identify motifs of interest

# load in input file

# check: does input files exist
# PROSITE is a big database where sequences can be given to it and it will return a list of matching domains. hopefully there is a function that will allow remote access


# check for non protein characters in the sequence, check if they match IUPAC ambiguity codes - Lecture 11 (hopefully PROSITE uses them). if not then remove.
